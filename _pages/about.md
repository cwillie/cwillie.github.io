##I'm a mathematics PhD student at the University of Illinois.



My master's thesis advisor was Nick Andersen, and my research was on modular forms and mock theta functions. 

Mock theta functions are mysterious objects first described by Ramanujan in his "deathbed" letter to GH Hardy, later shown to be the holomorphic parts of harmonic Maass forms of weight 1/2. 

In my master's thesis I constructed vector-valued mock-theta functions of orders 5, 7, and 11 transforming according to the Weil representation. Since then Nick and I have generalized this to all orders relatively prime to 6.
I also co-organize the Graduate Number Theory Seminar at UIUC.
